                Now that we know what we're up against, what we need is a game plan. But faced with so much existential risk, what game plan could there be?

            <div><img id="creativeDescentImg" src="descent.png"></img></div><br></br>
            <p>  We can guide human society into a “creative
                descent,” a gentle decline of complexity to more
                simple subsistence living by shifting to more 
                equitable resource distribution, renewable energy sources,
                and stable population growth. </p>

            <h1>Use Less Energy</h1><br>
            <p> At current rates, we will run out of the most widely available sources of energy in the next 100 years in which case if we would like to keep our modern conveniences, we need to budget them better. That being said, we have several options, but these options depend on there being enough non-renewable energy left to manufacture them. The best of these options being solar energy, as it's conventially known. In contrast to oil and coal reserves, solar energy is not very concentrated. The current return on investment for harvesting solar energy is considerably lower than for fossil fuels. It seems wise, therefore, to develop solar energy first in places where the largest energy gradient can be expected, namely in areas where there is sufficient sunshine and little or no vegetation –
                in other words, deserts. In an article in the science magazine New Scientist
                published in 2007 ce, it was pointed out that about 10,000 km2
                of photovoltaic cells in Texas or New Mexico could supply all the electricity needs of the
                United States, while 300,000 km2 of solar cells in the Sahara desert could generate all of the world’s energy needs, currently estimated to be about 15 terawatt.

            <h1>Slow Population Growth</h1><br>
            <p> A reasonably populated world relies on less energy, less food, and less waste, thus slowing the positive feedback loop all four challenges have with one another.
                Population growth rates have slowed in
                industrializing countries, such as India and
                China. This may be because economically
                developed countries tend to produce fewer
                children. But these children tend to be
                more highly educated, and as they join
                the billions of potential innovators already
                connected through the modern global
                communications network, this may be the key to saving our planet. Never before
                has collective learning been so accessible,
                integrated, and important.

            <h1>Stabilize Economic Growth</h1><br>
            <p> The idea that certain economies must continue growing indefinitely and inequitably causes a lot of harm politically, economically, and environmentally. Adopting a "good enough" policy could help us continue to live at sustainable levels of quality of life and reduce warfare over scarce resources such as oil, shale, and soon, solar energies.
