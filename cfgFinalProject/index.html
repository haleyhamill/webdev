                <br></br>
                The next 100 years of human history will be fraught with many economical, geological, and ethical quandaries. Whether we make it out on the other side may not even be entirely up to us. However, right now, we're not even trying -- and perhaps that's because we don't know how to get through the tunnel, because we don't even have a map. This small project hopes to shed light on the probable obstacles and possible solutions to the next 100 years of human history, to fix the headlights on our metaphorically speeding vehicle, to give us a sliver of hope.

            <h1>Wealth Inequality</h1><br>
            <p> More and more people in the developing world are forced away from their traditional ways of life and into factory jobs with poor safety standards, long hours, and measly wages. Since they can't afford them, a lot of the goods that they produce go overseas to enhance the standard of living of a prosperous and wealthy developed world. The ratio of impoverished to wealthy countries in 1820 was about 3:1, today, it’s closer to 72:1. Standards of living may be increasing on average, but the wealth inequality gap is getting wider and wider. The struggle for resources is one that is found in all walks of life, and usually the more struggle, the more violence. </p>

            <h1>Climate Change</h1><br>
            <p> Current modes of production rely heavily on nonrenewable resources that are not great for the environment. Unless you’ve been hiding under a rock for the past 20 years, you will probably have heard of climate change and the potentially devastating effects it will have. Furthermore, as humanity continues to force the environment to adapt to our needs, we are accelerating the rate of extinction of plant and animal species that don’t happen to be useful to us. One of the reasons we call this period the Anthropocene is, if humanity were to suddenly disappear and aliens were to land on Earth 500 million years later and start excavating, even if they saw no sign of the humans on the fossil record, they would see a mass extinction event rivaling the five most devastating mass extinctions in prehuman history.

            <h1>Population Growth</h1><br>
            <p>
                The tremendous expansion of populations in India and China have created a severe problem for the
                infrastructures of those countries. We now have seven billion people on Earth, and we’ll grow to between
                9.6 and 12 billion later in the century. Yet, at our current rates of consumption and modes of
                production, the world could only support a population of two or three billion people who enjoy the same
                standard of living as people in the United States do. China’s population may level off by around 2050.
                India’s might level off by 2070. But sub-Saharan Africa, a region of the world that already suffers from
                the highest levels of poverty and is least equipped to deal with problems of overpopulation, is set to
                expand enormously, even past the year 2100. Add to this the likelihood that climate change will reduce the amount of arable cropland on the earth by ten to 25 percent, and we may have a severe population
                problem on our hands. And as we can see from the population cycles of the agrarian period, overpopulation tends to spark more violence.

                <p>
                    Developing countries are more prone to use inexpensive, fast and dirty forms of fuel to develop rather than more expensive eco-friendly alternatives. This compounds the environmental/ climate
                    change problem, which, in turn, can mess up the environment and compound the population problem.

                            Of course this isn't everything. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it's that we

                            quickly once we are aware. These challenges are a start. The good thing? We already have
                            some of the solutions!
